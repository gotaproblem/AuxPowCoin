Mincoin Core 0.14.3
=====================

Setup
---------------------
Mincoin Core is the original Mincoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Mincoin transactions (which is currently 1 GB); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from an hour to a few hours or more.

To download Mincoin Core, visit [github.com](https://github.com/mincoin/mincoin/releases/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Mincoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/mincoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/mincoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run mincoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Mincoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Mincoin-Core.
